Welcom to Starlord and Rockets Github page here we discuss the background of the token and its niche.

In the vast expanse of the galaxy, where countless stories of adventure, politics, and trade unfold across star systems, the creation of a universal currency has been a pivotal development. Drawing inspiration from the iconic Star Wars saga, where Galactic Credits served as the main currency of the Galactic Republic and the subsequent Galactic Empire, a new cryptocurrency has emerged to unify the galaxy's diverse economies. This digital currency, named after the precious metals mined exclusively from a Lost Planet (Terra), pays homage to the concept of Galactic Credits, the backbone of economic activity in one of the most beloved outer space series of all time.

This cryptocurrency, an obvious nod to the Star Wars universe, is not only a medium for trade across solar systems but also a tribute to the enduring influence of science fiction on our imagination and technological aspirations. It's designed to facilitate trade and commerce from one end of the galaxy to another, making transactions seamless for traders navigating the complex networks of interstellar commerce.

Incorporating the latest in cryptographic security and built on the scarcity of terrestrial metals, this currency ensures that transactions are both safe and verifiable across vast distances. The choice to base this currency on physical resources from Earth (ETH) links it to tangible value, much like the Galactic Credits of Star Wars, which were once backed by the immense wealth and stability of the Galactic Republic.

The adoption of this cryptocurrency across galaxies is inspired by numerous works of science fiction, including:
 
Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series - exploring the idea of a universal currency within a sprawling galactic empire.
Frank Herbert's "Dune" - though centered around the trade of a unique substance, it underscores the importance of a unified economic system.
"The Expanse" by James S.A. Corey - illustrating the complexities of economic and political interdependence across space-faring civilizations.
Lastly, the journey through the stars in "Cowboy Bebop" emphasizes the fluidity and necessity of a common currency in navigating the frontiers of space, from bounty hunting to dealings with the underworld, underscoring the practicality and essential nature of having a universal monetary system.

To celebrate the legacy of Star Wars and its concept of Galactic Credits, an engaging campaign has been initiated: participants who identify references and inspirations from each space universe shared on the project's GitHub page, and possibly other science fiction literature, will be rewarded with galaxy credits, further immersing fans in the rich tapestry of intergalactic lore. That's right we are giving away free credits.


This initiative is not just a celebration of the cultural impact of Star Wars and the concept of a universal currency that binds diverse worlds together; it's also a testament to the potential of fiction to inspire real-world innovation. As this new cryptocurrency ventures to become the standard for interstellar trade, it carries with it the spirit of exploration and unity that Star Wars has epitomized for generations. 
To any Disney Lawyers out there, Calamari is the name of our fabled metal and BESKAR is the Symbol of the currency (our money). Nowhere do we use Galactic Credit (which you donâ€™t own) Calamari Flan (which is a soup) or Baskar Steal. Our metal comes from a lost earth and is named Calamari. BESKAR is the name of our money as WooLong was already taken. We are a tribute mothing more to space sagas. We all enjoy your films. Please leave us alone for a Woolong time.
We HOLD NO affiliation with DISNEY!!!
Thank You
